##App Magnets
* Determine app layout. `确定应用程序的布局`
* Build the GUI `构建用户图形界面`

* Handle the data `处理数据`
* Generate the email.  `生成电子邮件`

###Determine app layout.
Before you start coding anything, sketch up what you’re thinking.
###Build the GUI
Some people write backend code first—we’re going to go back and forth depending on our project, but to get started, we’ll do the GUI first this time.
### Figure out how to use the controls
After you’ve landed on the general app design, you need to get into the documentation a little and figure out how to implement the controls you’ve chosen.
###Handle the data
Here we need to manage the data coming from the controls.
###Generate the email.
We’ll help you out with this last step.
